Welcome to the **It Come with Egg Roll** project, the perfect blend of music generation and delicious humor. This app is the perfect appetizer for your musical creativity, offering a side of spontaneous chord progressions, served with a crispy GUI experience. Whether you're a musical chef or just here for the snacks, we've got something to satisfy your creative hunger.

## 🍜 **What's on the Menu?**

It’s simple: You choose a root note and a mode, and this app generates a **random chord progression** using some savory diatonic 7th chords. It’s like creating a musical egg roll — crispy, golden, and rolled up with a touch of creativity. Need a random progression? Don’t worry, we’ve got that covered too. Just press the "Randomize" button, and boom, you’ve got yourself a fresh, hot musical dish.

1. **Install the app** by running:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Run the command to bundle it into a single egg roll**:

## 🍱 **Why "It Come with Egg Roll"?**

Because good music, like good food, should always come with a little something extra on the side. That crispy crunch, that burst of flavor, the musical equivalent of dipping your egg roll into soy sauce. 🌟

And yes, the title *may* have been inspired by the famous saying "It comes with egg roll"—a little shoutout to all the takeout lovers out there! (We also think it sounds better than “It Comes with Tofu,” no offense to tofu fans.) 🥡

## 🚨 **Warning: Low Battery Alert (Fire Alarm Style)**

When the musical creation starts flowing, you might hear a *chirp* from the fire alarm, signaling the creative pressure building up in the air. But don't worry, it's just the sound of **a progression cooking** and the **battery of your brain working overtime**. If you feel the heat, just crank out more chord progressions — this app is built to withstand the heat!

If the fire alarm continues to beep, maybe it’s time for a snack break (or perhaps some new batteries for that metaphorical fire alarm). 🔋🚨

## 🍴 **Want to Give Feedback?**

If the app satisfies your cravings, great! If it doesn’t, we can *soy-sauce* it up a little more! Send us your thoughts — we’re always here to serve you better, and we promise we won’t be too *sour* about it.
